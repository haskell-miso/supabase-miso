[![Made with Supabase](https://supabase.com/badge-made-with-supabase.svg)](https://supabase.com)

A [Haskell](https://haskell.org) [miso](https://haskell-miso.org) client library for [supabase](https://supabase.com).

This is a [Haskell](https://haskell.org) front-end library, meant for use with the JS, or Web Assembly backend with GHC.

### Usage

For local development with [miso](https://github.com/dmjio/miso) you can include [supabase](https://github.com/supabase) as a JavaScript module.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = run $ startApp misoComponent
  { scripts =
     [ Module
        """
        import { createClient } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js/+esm'
        const supabase = createClient('https://<app-id>.supabase.co', '<anon-key>');
        globalThis['supabase'] = supabase;
        console.log('Supabase Instance: ', supabase)
        """
     ]
  }
```

### Build

```bash
$ cabal build
```
